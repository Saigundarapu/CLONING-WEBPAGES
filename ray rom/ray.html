      <h4>Jamie Floyd: <b><i>Upper West Side Classic 6</i></b></h4><br>
      <p>
        "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an
        eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone.
        It is CRAZY. But <br />
        we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it
        done! The place is beautiful!"
      </p><br>
      <h4>Donna and Scott: <b><i>Rescued Renovation</i></b></h4><br>
      <p>
        "Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are
        great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet
        before we knowbr it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond,"
        but on HGTV or TLC!"
      </p><br>
      <h4>David Siegel: <b><i>Doubled the Value</i></b> </h4><br>
      <p>
        "Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a
        pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut
        <br />renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make
        home improvements."
